        <h2>About us</h2>
        <div id="about" class="justified">
            <p>Art Market Serbia is an online gallery, made with the purpose to help Serbian artists to become
                internationally visible, to sell their artworks in-country and
                across the border, and to share their professional observations
                with colleagues and audience. The audience participates through
                comments, so they indirectly influence the artistic creative
                process. The connection between artists and their online
                international spectators is the core of our idea. </p>
            <p>Besides those international connections, our focus is on selling art.
                It is very important for us to make an economical cycle in which
                artists could be financially stable. That is why along with the
                online promotion of their work, we organize fundraising once per
                month, which makes us more visible and creates a base for firm
                connections with our business partners. </p>
            <p>Considering the use of our website, artists create their profiles
                and arrange their artworks with all information. Also, artists
                could use our "Artists talk" section to share their views, professional
                articles, creative ideas, or artist statements. That is how they
                are becoming more approachable to the audience, who are welcome
                to discuss topics. </p>

        <div id="about_founder">
        <main class="justified">
            <p>The founder of our organization and creator of the whole idea is Smiljana AntiÄ‡.
                Self-taught artist, Smiljana has been curating art for about a decade now, starting
                with a gallery in Belgarde. She also took the time to jury multiple shows, her passion
                for art being so great.</p>
            <p>After curating at the gallery for just over a year, she took the time to pursue
                her own art again while interning for KC Grad beside the
                executive director.</p>
            <p>She then took another break while having her first daughter, but found herself missing her
                involvement as both an artist and a curator greatly, so she
                began curating at a local coffee shop for two years, gaining
                the respect of many artists and others related to the field.
                After censorship issues and stepping down from the position
                there, she partnered up with Amanda Thoron Walton and developed
                what is now known as Art Market Serbia, with Smiljana heading
                the operations of the online gallery herself.</p>
            <p>They opened their "doors" on September 14, 2019; just a month shy of meeting and partnering.
                Both Amanda and Smiljana are artists and curators, so they understand the whole artistic cycle,
                together with the needs of both artists and spectators.
                Their life experience helped them to create a self-sustaining
                organization, whose purpose is to liberate and support the local
                art scene. </p>
